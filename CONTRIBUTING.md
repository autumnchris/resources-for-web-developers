# Contributing Guidelines

Before submitting a new resource in a pull request:
* Check if the resource isn't already added to the project list.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make an individual pull request for each resource you add.
* Be honest as to whether any part of the resource requires payment.
* Please only submit a paid resource if there are free options available that are more than sufficient or if you think the resource is absolutely worth purchasing.

If you see an inaccuracy for a listed resource, feel free to make a pull request for it.
