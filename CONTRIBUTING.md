# Contributing Guidelines

Before submitting a new resource in a pull request:
* Check if the resource isn't already added to the project list.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make an individual pull request for each resource you add.
* Be honest as to whether any part of the resource requires payment.
* Please only submit a paid resource if it is at least partially free and still more than sufficient as that or if you think the resource is absolutely worth purchasing.

If you see an inaccuracy for a listed resource, feel free to make a pull request for it.
